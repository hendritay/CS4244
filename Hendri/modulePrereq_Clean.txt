GEM3901, Ideally, a student should have completed the University Town Residential Programme of five modules before embarking on this UROP. However, due to the diverse student population at Tembusu, the prerequisite is that students should have completed at least one Senior Seminar at the College, as well as at least one Ideas and Exposition module or a faculty-based writing course. This ensures that the student has gained familiarity with the ways of working and norms for academic engagement at Tembusu College and has had some training in academic writing. Besides preparing the student, these prerequisites allow the College to make an assessment regarding the student’s suitability for a UROP and potential to benefit from it. Approval for any particular UROP needs to be secured from the College through the Director of Studies.
